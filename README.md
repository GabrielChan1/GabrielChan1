## Welcome to my Github page!

I am a Full Stack Developer skilled in both front and back end development. I love to create and build especially with code. What I love the most about coding is its modular structure and how programs and applications can be built in small blocks and functions at a time.

I started learning programming while studying Computer Science at University of Toronto. During this time, I learned to use many programming languages including Python, Java and C as well as programming practices like object-oriented programming and test-driven development. After my time at University of Toronto, I continued to learn to use more languages, technologies and frameworks like JavaScript, React.js and Storybook.js.

Currently, I am working with BlueWave Labs to develop one of their human resources applications as a Front End Developer. 

## My stacks:

I primarily use JavaScript, React.js and Storybook.js for front end development. I love using React because of it gives a more modular and flexible structure to HTML and CSS with its ability to build components as functions which then can be used as HTML elements. Storybook.js is useful for previewing each component from the smallest button to an entire web page and it allows me to easily test new changes and see their results.

I mainly use Python, Java and Express.js for back end development. I am particularly interested in Java because of how it incorporates many elements of object-oriented programming which provides it structure but also simplicity.
